                  Welcome to crossorigin.me, the free CORS proxy for everyone!
              </p>
              <p>
                  A CORS proxy is a service that allows developers (probably you) to access resources from other websites, without having to own that website.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Most of what you need to know is on this page, but you can find links to more detailed information in each section.
              </p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="grey" id="how">
            <div class="inner">
              <h1>How do I use it?</h1>
              <p>
                  When you need to access a resource from a website that isn't CORS-enabled, add 'http://crossorigin.me' to the beginning of that URL.
              </p>
              <p>
                  For example, if you wanted to grab the Google homepage, your code would request
                  <code>
                  https://crossorigin.me/https://google.com
                  </code>
              </p>
              <p>
                  There are a few limitations on how you can use it, so be sure to read the below section carefully.
              </p>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="green" id="fyi">
            <div class="inner">
              <h1>A few caveats</h1>
              <p>
                  There is a 2MB size limit on files passed through the proxy, due to bandwidth concerns.
                  If you attempt to access a larger file, you will get a 413 error and the proxy will simply stop sending data.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">CORS specification</a>
                  requires all CORS requests to include an <span class="code">Origin</span> header in every request,
                  so crossorigin.me will respond to requests that do not include it with
                  <code>
                      Origin: header is required
                  </code>
                  Most HTTP request libraries add this header for you, but this means that you cannot test crossorigin.me
                  by using your browser.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Currently, crossorigin.me only supports <span class="code">GET</span> requests.
                  Supporting <span class="code">PUT</span> and <span class="code">POST</span>
                  requests is planned, but I'm trying to get the proxy running consistently first.

                  I spend a lot of free time maintaining the proxy, and I could use some extra caffeine so I can get homework done too. :)
